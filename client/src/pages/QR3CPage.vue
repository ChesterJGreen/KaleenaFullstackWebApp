                    <p>Gavin leaned against the brightly-lit machine and watched his cute little redhead cash in her
                        chips at the cashiers. He had thought it was going well at the craps table between them, but
                        then she had walked away.</p>
                    <p>He was at a loss at how to pull off this first time meeting idea. He felt stupid not knowing if
                        he should introduce himself or just ease on up and play it cool.</p>
                    <p>Gavin’s phone vibrated in his pocket and he pulled it out. He sat in the seat of the slot
                        machine, making sure he still had a decent view of his date, and answered the call.</p>
                    <p>“Dude come on, you can do this,” Austin started in on him without a greeting. “Turn on the charm
                        and get your head in the game. You want to make her happy, don’t you?”</p>
                    <p>Gavin peeked around the machine. Dang, she looked good in those jeans and soft blouse. She was
                        still at the cashier booth. “Yes, of course I do.” </p>
                    <p>“Remember, it’s your first time meeting. Sweep her off her feet like in a chick flick. It’s what
                        every girl wants, especially her.”</p>
                    <p>Is that what every woman wanted?</p>
                    <p>Gavin unconsciously traced the design of horse and rider on his belt buckle and an idea hit him.
                        He’d ease on in, just like gaining trust with a new horse. But he’d do more than just earn her
                        trust; he would fully capture his wife-to-be’s heart.</p>
