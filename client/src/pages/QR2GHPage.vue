                    <p class="px-5">I listened to Dierks Bentley sing this in his home town.
                        It was my first concert in the pit and I loved the intensity of the music
                        and the songs being performed. I Hold On, in particular made this night memorable. Dierks played
                        with the guitar he sings about and talked about the old beat up truck he still treasures. It was
                        magic that night as I swayed back and forth in the arms of my husband who said he would always
                        hold onto me.</p>

                    <p class="px-5">I feel like this song resonates perfectly with Gavin from his old beat-up truck to
                        the land and love he will give his everything to hold on to.</p>
