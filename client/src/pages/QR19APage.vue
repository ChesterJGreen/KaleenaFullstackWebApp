                    <p>“Wake up,” a voice from the past called through her dream. Sarah opened her eyes and lifted her head. Gavin
                        was standing outside the passenger door. “We’re home. I’ll help you inside.”<br>
                        It was dark. “Is that you, Gavin? I didn’t wake up married to someone else, did I?”<br>
                        With a low chuckle, the cowboy scooped her into his arms and carried her through the blackness into the house.
                        “This does seem vaguely familiar, doesn’t it? Only it’s not raining and I’m hopeful you won’t lock me out after I
                        unload the truck.”<br>
                        Eyes closed, Sarah snickered quietly, resting against calendar boy’s strong chest. Gavin walked straight to her
                        bedroom and laid her down on her bed. <br>
                        “Here’s your little guy, just waitin’ for ya.” Gavin scooped a sleepy Patches into her arms. Her whole body
                        sighed with relief and she lay back on her pillows. “Your boots are dusty.” He moved her feet to the side of her
                        bed and took her boots off from the heel. It was sweet. “Doesn't feel sprained this time.” From the light in the
                        hallway, Sarah saw Gavin wink. His hand gently encircled her ankle, touch entirely too familiar, too
                        pleasurable, and too short. “Good night.” He patted her calf and shut the door behind him.
                        For the next hour, Sarah lay awake cuddling with Patches, trying to convince herself that her emotions and
                        feelings over Gavin’s rescue, deep caring looks, and gentle caresses meant nothing. The kisses they had shared
                        meant nothing. That he meant nothing to her.<br>
                        Nothing.<br>
                        Nothing.<br>
                        Nothing.</p>
