                    I was very young when my mom took me to my first horse cutting event in Salt Lake City, Utah. My uncle was competing and I was absolutely astounded at how the cowboys worked and moved with their horses without using the reins.  I have a lot of respect for this sport. The horse and rider have to be completely in sync with a drive to win. I love when people work and share a close bond with their animals like this. 
Gavin has this close bond to his horses, especially Shadowlight.
