                    <p>Phil took out his phone as soon as Gavin and his wife pulled out of the post office parking lot
                        in that junkie old Ford. His sister would be ticked off if he didn’t start with her. He’d call
                        everyone else after.<br>
                        Phil knew his sister would be jealous he’d seen Mrs. Sterling Marshall first. The question was,
                        how much should he rub it in?<br>
                        “Hello?”<br>
                        “Sal, you won’t believe who finally came out of his hole and popped into the post office.”<br>
                        “Did you finally get that gopher that’s been digging up the back?”<br>
                        “No.”<br>
                        “Ah! Was it that rat that has been scratching around in your walls?”<br>
                        “Sal, that rat is at home in my shed, not the post station.”<br>
                        “Oh, right. Did a coyote come in? Did you leave the front door open again? Because I don’t care
                        how much you want fresh air in there, the flies just follow the air conditioner to the cool
                        breeze.”<br>
                        Phil’s hand hit his forehead. “Sal, would you stop talking for a minute so I can rub somethin’
                        in your face properly.”<br>
                        “Well, what’s got your panties in a wad?”<br>
                        “Gavin Marshall and his new wife just came in to pick up their post.”<br>
                        Sal gasped on the line and a satisfying smile broke out across Phil’s face. “They did? What did
                        she look like?”<br>
                        “Drop dead gorgeous supermodel if I’ve ever seen one.” A large smile lit his face. Her red hair
                        and matching lips gave him goosebumps.<br>
                        “Oh, thank heavens! Gavin deserves a pretty girl. Was she nice?”<br>
                        “She didn’t say much, but after Gavin opened his package I had here behind the counter—you know
                        the one he had to sign for?”<br>
                        “Yeah?” Sal said eagerly. Phil could tell he was building the anticipation just right, keeping
                        his sister on the edge of her seat.<br>
                        “Gavin swung her around and dipped her down into the biggest kiss I’ve ever seen with my own two
                        eyes. And that was just the beginning. They kept kissin’ over what was in that package like I
                        wasn’t even here.” Sal gasped again. He loved it when he had the better story over his sister.
                        There wouldn’t be any harm in ramping up the action just a bit more. “She had her hands all over
                        him. Just watching it made me need to crank up the air conditioning before they left. He was
                        running his fingers through her fiery red hair. Heaven knows only a cowboy could take the heat
                        like that and not get incinerated from the flames.”<br>
                        “Don’t be sellin’ me a dog, Phil. I can’t go spreading news if it ain’t true.”<br>
                        “I ain’t lyin’. They made out right in my post office, right before my own eyes. Didn’t even try
                        to hide it or nuttin.”<br>
                        “And you said she was gorgeous?”<br>
                        “Oh yeah. Blue eyes like diamonds. Curves in all the right places. He waited for the right one.
                        That girl Anne that pines over him is going to blow a gasket when she sees them together.”<br>
                        “I owe you one, brother—guess who just walked into the shop?”<br>
                        “Oh Saaallll!” Phil knew Mrs. Crawley’s voice anywhere. “Guess who I just ran into at the
                        grocery store?”<br>
                        Sal huffed into the phone. “I don’t care what she says; I’ve got a better scoop than her this
                        time. Thanks, brother.” The line went dead.<br>
                        Phil pulled up his contact list on his cell and began whistling. Now, who was he going to call
                        next?<br>
