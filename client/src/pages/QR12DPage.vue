                <h5>
                    <p> It was past midnight and the moon was giving her the needed light. Sarah pulled Gavin’s keys
                        from her pocket and stepped up to the driver’s side of The Beast. Rowdy hadn’t been in Gavin’s
                        room, allowing her to sneak the cowboy’s phone and keys without waking him. She prayed that the
                        dog had fallen asleep somewhere out in the pastures.<br>
                        The thought must have jinxed her, because suddenly, Rowdy’s barking cut through the stillness of
                        the night like a knife. Sarah turned to see him running towards her in the dim light of the
                        moon. He halted to a stop at her feet.<br>
                        “Hush!” She held his snout closed with one hand while petting him with the other. “Quiet, boy.”
                        Gavin had said he was well trained; she only needed to be firm. “Go to sleep in the barn.” She
                        pointed and pushed him towards the red building.<br>
                        Rowdy barked again and Sarah cringed, frozen with dread. She looked at the house. No light
                        turned on or door swung open. She breathed a sigh of relief and turned her attention back to
                        Rowdy.<br>
                        “Quiet!” she commanded the dog once again. “Go sleep in the barn. Go, boy!” She motioned, but
                        Rowdy didn’t move.<br>
                        She shoved the keys in her pocket and walked Rowdy to the barn. “Stay, boy.” She pointed to the
                        ground and Rowdy sat on his haunches. “Good boy.” She petted him behind the ears. He barked once
                        and Sarah couldn’t be sure if there’d been a noise by the house. “No bark! Now stay.”<br>
                        She turned and ran back to the truck. She needed to hurry. The keys got stuck in her pocket, and
                        her heart dropped when they flipped out and hit the ground.<br>
                        “Shoot!”<br>
                        There was barely enough light to see properly and the dark ground hid the keys that would have
                        been in plain sight had it been day. Her hands felt along the dirt and rock until they hit
                        metal. The Beast’s engine would be noisy when she roared it to life, but she would be able to
                        drive away before Gavin could do anything about it.<br>
                        A smile graced her lips over the thought, and she rose to pull open the truck door. Her hand
                        grasped the metal and she yanked hard, but half a second later, an opposing force slammed the
                        door shut.<br>
                        “Goin’ somewhere?” A deep voice next to her ear made her gasp, and her heart vaulted out of her
                        chest.<br>
                        Sarah spun around to find Gavin’s hand holding the door closed. Before she could bolt, his other
                        hand pressed against The Beast on the opposite side of her, pinning her to the window.<br>
                        She had been caught, and to make matters worse, Gavin was in nothing more than a pair of pajama
                        pants, his bare chest just inches away from her. Her new red boots brought her up several inches
                        closer to his face.<br>
                        All the moisture shriveled out of her throat and her tongue became thick. She made to duck under
                        Gavin’s arm and run out into the darkness, but quick as a lasso on an unsuspecting calf, Gavin
                        caught her.<br>
                        “Hey now,” he said, keeping his composure. “It’s okay, I’m not mad. Just glad I caught you.”
                        Sarah’s breathing sped up at being so close together. But the sound of Rowdy’s bark snapped her
                        out of it. He bounded towards them from the barn.<br>
                        “Good boy, Rowdy.” Gavin thanked his dog for the success. Had he purposely left Rowdy out of the
                        house as a test? Rowdy barked again and nuzzled his face against their legs.<br>
                        Gavin’s eyes traveled over her. “Did I tell you how beautiful you look in this dress today?”<br>
                        Sarah looked down. Why had she not changed out of it? It was not a good getaway outfit.<br>
                        Gavin’s fingers traced the lace over her arms. “I can see your skin just here through the beams
                        of moonlight.” The sensation stole her breath in a way she told herself she couldn’t let happen.
                        His lack of anger threw her off guard. Why wasn’t he upset about this? Curse this cowboy and his
                        dog.<br>
                        “Let me go.” Sarah wiggled. “Let me take the truck and go.”<br>
                        Gavin chuckled under his breath, holding her tighter. “I’m never,” he bent down closer to her
                        ear, “letting you go.” He kissed the side of her neck, sending a shiver over her. “Sterling.” He
                        kissed her neck again and this time the soft sensation made her close her eyes. “Sterling.”
                        No—she couldn’t savor the feeling of his lips on her skin, but she did, too weakened by the
                        sensation to push him away. He whispered as he kissed her again. “Sterling.”<br>
                        Why did he have to use that name while he kissed her?<br>
                        The reflection of sterling silver earrings caught her attention in the side mirror of the truck.
                        Dark black makeup encircled her eyes and she watched as every kiss Gavin gave her crept closer
                        to her lips. Her hands softened against his chest and black dye started creeping up the ends of
                        her hair. Early morning sunbeams began to brighten the sky, and the passing of night took away
                        her cares.<br>
                        His warm lips were almost to her mouth, the promised taste of heaven so close. Her anger had
                        waned. It would be okay to stay a little longer.<br>
                        She blinked and saw her nails were painted black, matching the color change of her dress.<br>
                        Everything about her in the mirror’s reflection was black, but it was okay. Gavin’s mouth was
                        almost to hers.<br>
                        “Sterling.”<br>
                        The brightness of the sun cresting the horizon blinded her and Sarah blinked hard.<br>
                        Wait, it wasn’t the sun that was blinding her. Her hand moved to cover her eyes. She was in her
                        bedroom and Gavin was standing inside by the light switch.<br>
                        The escape had all been a dream. She’d tried to sneak into his room last night. Lingered on and
                        off outside of his door, but he kept talking to Rowdy for some stupid reason. One of Sarah’s
                        arms covered her eyes and the other threw a pillow at the cowboy. “Stay away from me.”<br>
                        “Geesh!” Gavin was ready for the day in his button-up shirt and jeans, and had even combed his
                        hair extra nice. “It sounded like you were having a nightmare in here.”<br>
                        “I was, no thanks to you.” She pouted and rolled over.<br>
                        Rowdy barked from the hallway. “I sent Rowdy to wake you up, but apparently you were in such a
                        deep sleep you didn’t hear his barkin’ through the door.”<br>
                        “Oh, I heard him alright,” she grumbled, and covered her head with her comforter. It wasn’t the
                        fact that both in her dream and real life she had failed to escape. Or even the fact that the
                        dream Gavin had weakened her resolve with his kisses. That happened in real life.<br>
                        No, it was succumbing to the blackness that scared her the most, making the dream her true
                        nightmare.
