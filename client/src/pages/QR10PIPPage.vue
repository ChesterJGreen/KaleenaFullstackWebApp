                    <p>The golden peaches in Sarah’s bowl swirled around as she tried to cut one of the halves into
                        bite-sized pieces. Sticky juice speckled the counter, and she carefully avoided the mess.<br>
                        “My name is Sarah.”<br>
                        “Don’t start this—”<br>
                        “If you’d only just let me call Joan, you’d see.” She tried her hardest to stay calm in front of
                        the deranged man in front of her. And she had thought Joan was stubborn. Gavin’s determination
                        blew her best friend’s out of the water.<br>
                        “No.” Gavin shook his head. “You and your dad are the ones who set the terms of no contact with
                        friends until Christmas.”<br>
                        “Christmas?” She held in a growl. Stupid Austin. “Listen, this isn’t only about me. Without my
                        money, Joan can’t afford to pay all the living expenses and will lose the apartment. Plus she
                        has medical bills she still owes on.”<br>
                        Worry for Joan plagued her. Her best friend thought Sarah had abandoned her for a blind date: a
                        guy she barely knew. For weeks, Sarah had begged to call, but the obstinate cowboy wouldn’t
                        relent.<br>
                        Gavin’s arms crossed over his chest. Sarah blinked away the attraction—it wasn’t fair that he
                        could be appealing and awful at the same time.<br>
                        “Joan is going to be fine.” He sighed. “Tell you what, I’ll call Gunther today and have him make
                        sure Joan has enough money. I don’t want that for her either.”<br>
                        Sarah couldn’t stop her eyeroll. “If only that would work.”<br>
                        Calendar cowboy’s eyes and stance suddenly softened. “You need to believe that Joan is going to
                        be okay without you, and you are going to be just fine without her. You’ve got me to take care
                        of you. And I’m not going anywhere, because nothing with great value, like our marriage, is
                        gonna come easy. It’s the effort we put into our love—building it from the ground up, that makes
                        it worth the struggle.”<br>
                        Gavin recited her mother’s saying nearly word for word and her involuntary gasp lodged a peach
                        in her windpipe. She pounded her chest and tried to cough up the fruit, choking on both the
                        sweetness of the peach and calendar cowboy’s words.<br>
                        “How did you—” cough, cough, “my mom—” cough, sputter.<br>
                        Gavin handed her a glass of water and she gratefully drank the cool liquid. His chivalry was
                        wearing her armor thin.<br>
                        How had he known—no, he couldn’t know that’s what her mom used to say. Unless Austin had told
                        him. Sarah pounded her chest and coughed some more before taking another sip of water. The
                        manipulative jerk Austin, had used her mother’s words to propel her to Vegas, and now Gavin was
                        unintentionally using them to keep her there.<br>
                        Rowdy whined by her side. “She’s all right, boy.” He rubbed his dog behind the ears. Rowdy was
                        growing on her, but she tried not to engage him. She didn’t need her heart to be sad any more
                        than it already was going to be when she left her misguided storybook romance.<br>
                        Sarah pounded her chest and coughed some more. Even though he soothed his dog, Gavin’s brown was
                        creased. Stupid small town upbringing. She had to find a chink in his armor, and soon.<br>
                        “Let’s go out after I finish up with the tractor repairs.”<br>
                        Sarah set her glass down and had to hold her jaw in place. Unfortunately, her shocked tone gave
                        her emotions away. “You’re really taking me out?”<br>
                        “Yeah, to the grocery store.”<br>
                        Sarah couldn’t believe it. After all these days she was finally getting out of this house and
                        back to civilization. “In The Beast?” She had to make sure he wasn’t lying.<br>
                        He shrugged. “We’re getting low on food and I think we could both use a little outing.” It
                        wasn’t fair. Sure, he was a stubborn mule with metaphorical cotton in his ears, but his genuine
                        concern and sweetness were always there. She’d just have to use that against him.<br>
                        A smile sprouted on her lips. “Yes I could.”<br>
                        It was time to recruit some help and show that cowboy he had the wrong woman.</p>
